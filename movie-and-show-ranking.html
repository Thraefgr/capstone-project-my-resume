<h1>The Best Movies and Shows According to Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>It is all around a great film with great actors, writing and all that stuff.</p>

<h3>The Green Mile</h3>
<p>Beware of this film! Because it can make you cry. A lot!!</p>

<h3>Spider-Man 2</h3>
<p>I am not really sure with this one. So I put my favorite superhero film.</p>
<br/>
<h2>My top 3 shows of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Office (American Version)</h3>
<p>Ofcourse this is the greatest comedy-drama show of all-time with unique characters and story.</p>

<h3>Hannibal</h3>
<p>Great characters, great atmosphere and fine mysteries with shocking twists!</p>

<h3>Sherlock Holmes</h3>
<p>I am bit biased when it comes to Sherlock Holmes. But other than that it's a fine show.</p>

<p>
    Not: I could put Sherlock Holmes film series in my top 3 movies but I wasn't sure even though I like films more than the show.<br/>
    And for the shows I've really enjoyed "Scrubs" too a great comedy-drama that could rival "The Office".<br/>
    If I would have finished watching "The Godfather" or "Better Call Saul" I would probably put them in my lists.
