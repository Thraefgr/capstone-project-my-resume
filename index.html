                <h2>Who am I Really?</h2>
                <p>
                    First of all nice to meet you! Lets start explaining. I graduated from MIT 2 years ago. I've been working for Google as Junior Frontend Developer since then.<br/>
                    Nah just kidding. I am just a university student from Turkey and I've just finished my second year couple of months ago.<br/>
                    For 2 years I've been learning different things on different topics. And I have been interested in lots of things including web.<br/>
                    For the first time <strong>I am serious</strong> on being a web developer and I will prove it to myself and you!<br/>
                    Now lets get on the next part! Uh I almost forgot, I am Ferhat!

                <h2>What Project Have I Done Till Now?</h2>
                <p>
                    This is gonna be an incredibly short one.<br/>
                    Well I have done course exercises and course projects.<br/>
                    Before this I built basic HTML and CSS stuffs and actually I built a basic website for my friend using HTML and CSS.<br/>
                    But they are in the past and to be honest I don't have these in my hands to show you.<br/>
                    So this place is basically blank but trust me I am gonna build great things!
