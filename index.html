            <h2>Who am I Really?</h2>
            <p>
                First of all nice to meet you! Lets start explaining. I graduated from MIT 2 years ago. I've been working for Google as Junior Frontend Developer since then.<br/>
                Nah just kidding. I am just a university student from Turkey and I've just finished my second year couple of months ago.<br/>
                For 2 years I've been learning different things on different topics. And I have been interested in lots of things including web.<br/>
                For the first time <strong>I am serious</strong> on being a web developer and I will prove it to myself and you!<br/>
                Now lets get on the next part!
